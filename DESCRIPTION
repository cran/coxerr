Description: Perform the functional modeling methods of Huang and Wang (2018) <doi:10.1111/biom.12741> to accommodate dependent error in covariates of the proportional hazards model. The adopted measurement error model has minimal assumptions on the dependence structure, and an instrumental variable is supposed to be available.
